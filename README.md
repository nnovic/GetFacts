###### News
GetFacts is designed to process any XML and HTML documents. The current developments concentrate on handling RSS feeds properly.

###### Agility
While RSS is standardized and thus very easy to process, analyzing HTML is quite complex. Every website has a unique design. GetFacts uses templates to determine, for each website, how to extract the interesting content. Templates are made of a few, well-chosen XPath and Regex queries; the complexity of writing such queries will be eased by the Templates Editor (still under development).

###### Style
GetFacts is meant to be visible at all times for your entertainment. Only a few articles are visible at a time, and the selection changes automatically after a short period of time. Your gaze will be attracted to recent articles thanks to a subtle animations and color schemes. Think of GetFacts a your own personal digital billboard!

# Download
GetFacts runs on Windows and requires .Net Framework.
The current development version is provided as portable application.

### Current development version
The current development version is [GetFacts_0.2_Portable.zip](docs/GetFacts_0.2_Portable.zip).
It is (should be ?) fully functional for RSS feeds.
